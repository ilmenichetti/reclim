abstract = {{Based on the Introductory Carbon Balance Model, ICBM, we present a set of analytically solved models. The original ICBM comprises `Young' and `Old' soil C, two decay constants and parameters for litter input,'humification' and external influences — in all five parameters. The new models describe soil C (and N) balances more in detail, but they are built around the same core concepts such as first-order decomposition kinetics and a minimum number of soil C and N pools. More complex processes, such as plant growth and mortality as well as weather influence are not explicitly included. However, these processes are allowed to influence the model predictions by modifying model parameter values. These modifications may be based on `best guesses', parameter optimisations to available data, or independent `front-end models', e.g. calculations of temperature influence on decomposer activity. Listed according to increasing complexity, the models are: (1) ICBM/N, which is ICBM with nitrogen added. It calculates net N-mineralisation and adds parameters for C/N ratios and soil organisms as well as organism efficieny \textbackslashtextemdash nine parameters in all; (2) ICBM/2N, which gives a more precise description of the initial stages of decomposition by splitting the `Young' pool into two. The nitrogen part of the model has parameters for the C/N ratios of `labile' and `refractory' input of organic material, organism biomass and humification and also microbial growth efficiency for `labile' and `refractory'. The model has 13 parameters in all, but can be run as a pure C model (ICBM/2) with only seven parameters; (3) ICBM/2BN, where organism biomass C and N is explicitly modelled. This model is usually run with daily, weekly or monthly steps and adds parameters related to biomass \textbackslashtextemdash 18 parameters in total \textbackslashtextemdash and can be run as a pure C model (ICBM/2B) with 13 parameters or even as a model with only one `Young' pool (ICBM/B). We give examples of model applications, both short- and long-term, and show that the models relatively easily can be applied to various, more or less incomplete, data sets. The models do not require simulation techniques and are easily programmed in, e.g. electronic spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. By transformation of the time steps even dynamic driving variables, e.g. weather-related, can be applied without simulation.

abstract = {{Abstract             The conventional soil organic matter (SOM) decay paradigm considers the intrinsic quality of SOM as the dominant decay limitation with the result that it is modelled using simple first-order decay kinetics. This view and modelling approach is often criticized for being too simplistic and unreliable for predictive purposes. It is still under debate if first-order models can correctly capture the variability in temporal SOM decay observed between different agroecosystems and climates. To address this question, we calibrated a first-order model (Q) on six long-term bare fallow field experiments across Europe. Following conventional SOM decay theory, we assumed that parameters directly describing SOC decay (rate of SOM quality change and decomposer metabolism) are thermodynamically constrained and therefore valid for all sites. Initial litter input quality and edaphic interactions (both local by definition) and microbial efficiency (possibly affected by nutrient stoichiometry) were instead considered site-specific. Initial litter input quality explained most observed kinetics variability, and the model predicted a convergence toward a common kinetics over time. Site-specific variables played no detectable role. The decay of decades-old SOM seemed mostly influenced by OM chemistry and was well described by first order kinetics and a single set of general kinetics parameters.}},
