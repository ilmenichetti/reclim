## Potential evapotranspiration

## Biomass phenology functions (G.A.I. estimates)

## Soil water balance
The steps of the calculation are already described in the manual, but here we will examine some of them in more detail.
Step 1: Soil water W is initialized assuming saturation, based on the depth L and volumetric capacity  
$W[1] = \Theta_f \cdot L$  
Step 2: The single crop coefficient Kc is calculated based on GAI  
$K_c=1.3-0.5 \cdot exp(-0.17 \cdot GAI)$  
Step 3: calculation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) under standard condition  
$ET_c=ET_0 \cdot K_c$  
Step 4:  the intercepted water It is calculated based on crop ET, GAI and precipitation P  
$It=min(P,ET_c,0.2 \cdot GAI)$  
Step 5:  potential evapotraspiration is calculated  
$E_{pot}=(ET_c-It)$  
Step 6:  Calculation of the percolation. Water (W_b, water bypass) is lost when above field capacity, but allowing saturation for one day  
$W_b = max(0, W-(\Theta_f \cdot L))$  
Step 7:  Soil evaporation reduction coefficient  
$Kr=\left(1-\frac{0.95 \cdot \Theta_{field}-\Theta}{0.95 \cdot \Theta_{field}-\alpha \cdot \Theta_{wilt}}\right)^2$  
This function expresses the actual evaporation, and in it it is considered that even below wilting point there is some biological activity. The function is zero below wilting point.  
A subsequent conditions is applied so that Kr cannot be above one.
Step 8:  Actual evapotraspiration is calculated  
$E_{act}=E_{pot} \cdot Kr$  
Step 9:  The water balance is calculated (stepwise)  
$W[i+1]=W[i]+P[i]-E_{act}[i]-It-W_b[i]$

## Normalization and averaging

Vignettes are long form documentation commonly included in packages. Because they are part of the distribution of the package, they need to be as compact as possible. The `html_vignette` output type provides a custom style sheet (and tweaks some options) to ensure that the resulting html is as small as possible. The `html_vignette` format:

- Never uses retina figures
- Has a smaller default figure size
- Uses a custom CSS stylesheet instead of the default Twitter Bootstrap style

## Vignette Info

Note the various macros within the `vignette` section of the metadata block above. These are required in order to instruct R how to build the vignette. Note that you should change the `title` field and the `\VignetteIndexEntry` to match the title of your vignette.

## Styles

The `html_vignette` template includes a basic CSS theme. To override this theme you can specify your own CSS in the document metadata as follows:

    output: 
      rmarkdown::html_vignette:
        css: mystyles.css

## Figures

The figure sizes have been customised so that you can easily put two images side-by-side. 

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
plot(1:10)
plot(10:1)
```

You can enable figure captions by `fig_caption: yes` in YAML:

    output:
      rmarkdown::html_vignette:
        fig_caption: yes

Then you can use the chunk option `fig.cap = "Your figure caption."` in **knitr**.

## More Examples

You can write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 10))
```
