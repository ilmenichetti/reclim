abstract = {{Based on the Introductory Carbon Balance Model, ICBM, we present a set of analytically solved models. The original ICBM comprises `Young' and `Old' soil C, two decay constants and parameters for litter input,'humification' and external influences — in all five parameters. The new models describe soil C (and N) balances more in detail, but they are built around the same core concepts such as first-order decomposition kinetics and a minimum number of soil C and N pools. More complex processes, such as plant growth and mortality as well as weather influence are not explicitly included. However, these processes are allowed to influence the model predictions by modifying model parameter values. These modifications may be based on `best guesses', parameter optimisations to available data, or independent `front-end models', e.g. calculations of temperature influence on decomposer activity. Listed according to increasing complexity, the models are: (1) ICBM/N, which is ICBM with nitrogen added. It calculates net N-mineralisation and adds parameters for C/N ratios and soil organisms as well as organism efficieny \textbackslashtextemdash nine parameters in all; (2) ICBM/2N, which gives a more precise description of the initial stages of decomposition by splitting the `Young' pool into two. The nitrogen part of the model has parameters for the C/N ratios of `labile' and `refractory' input of organic material, organism biomass and humification and also microbial growth efficiency for `labile' and `refractory'. The model has 13 parameters in all, but can be run as a pure C model (ICBM/2) with only seven parameters; (3) ICBM/2BN, where organism biomass C and N is explicitly modelled. This model is usually run with daily, weekly or monthly steps and adds parameters related to biomass \textbackslashtextemdash 18 parameters in total \textbackslashtextemdash and can be run as a pure C model (ICBM/2B) with 13 parameters or even as a model with only one `Young' pool (ICBM/B). We give examples of model applications, both short- and long-term, and show that the models relatively easily can be applied to various, more or less incomplete, data sets. The models do not require simulation techniques and are easily programmed in, e.g. electronic spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. By transformation of the time steps even dynamic driving variables, e.g. weather-related, can be applied without simulation.

abstract = {{Abstract             The conventional soil organic matter (SOM) decay paradigm considers the intrinsic quality of SOM as the dominant decay limitation with the result that it is modelled using simple first-order decay kinetics. This view and modelling approach is often criticized for being too simplistic and unreliable for predictive purposes. It is still under debate if first-order models can correctly capture the variability in temporal SOM decay observed between different agroecosystems and climates. To address this question, we calibrated a first-order model (Q) on six long-term bare fallow field experiments across Europe. Following conventional SOM decay theory, we assumed that parameters directly describing SOC decay (rate of SOM quality change and decomposer metabolism) are thermodynamically constrained and therefore valid for all sites. Initial litter input quality and edaphic interactions (both local by definition) and microbial efficiency (possibly affected by nutrient stoichiometry) were instead considered site-specific. Initial litter input quality explained most observed kinetics variability, and the model predicted a convergence toward a common kinetics over time. Site-specific variables played no detectable role. The decay of decades-old SOM seemed mostly influenced by OM chemistry and was well described by first order kinetics and a single set of general kinetics parameters.}},

abstract = {{Modelling of ecosystem processes often requires soil temperature as a driving variable. Since soil temperature measurements are seldom available for regional applications, they have to be estimated from standard meteorological data. The objective of this paper is to present a general, simple empirical approach for estimating daily depth profiles of soil temperature from air temperature and a surface cover index (LAI; leaf area index) mainly focusing on agricultural soils in cold temperate regions. Air and soil temperature data measured daily or every fifth day at one to six different depths were acquired from all meteorological stations in Sweden where such records are available. The stations cover latitudes from 55.658 to 68.428 N and mean annual air temperatures from '8.6 to (0.6 8C. The time series spanned between two and ten years. The soils at the stations cover a wide range of soil textures, including two organic soils. We calibrated the model first for each station and then for all stations together and the general parameterization only slightly decreased the goodness of fit. This general model then was applied to two treatments in a field experiment: bare soil and a winter rape crop. The parameters governing the influence of LAI on heat fluxes were optimized using this experiment. Finally, the model was validated using soil temperature data from two barley treatments differing in LAI taken from another field experiment. In general, the model predicted daily soil temperature profiles well. For all soils and depths at the meteorological stations, 95\% of the simulated daily soil temperatures differed by less than 2.8 8C from measurements. The corresponding differences were somewhat higher for the validation data set (3.9 8C), but bias was still low. The model explained 95\textbackslash\% of the variation in the validation data. Since no site-specific adjustments were made in the validation simulations, we conclude that the application of the general model presented here will result in good estimates of soil temperatures under cold temperate conditions. The very limited input requirements (only air temperature and LAI) that are easily obtainable from weather stations and from satellites make this model suitable for spatial applications at catchment or regional scales.}},

abstract = {{The literature was reviewed regarding laboratory incubation studies where C mineralization was measured. Experiments were selected in which the same substrate was incubated at least at two different temperatures and where time-series were available with at least four measurements for each substrate and temperature. A first-order one-component model and a parallel first-order two-component model were fitted to the CO2–C evolution data in each experiment using a least-squares procedure. After normalising for a reference temperature, the temperature coefficient (Q10) function and three other temperature response functions were fitted to the estimated rate constants. The two-component model could describe the dynamics of the 25 experiments much more adequately than the one-component model (higher R2, adjusted for the number of parameters), even when the rate constants for both were assumed to be equally affected by temperature. The goodness-of-fit did not differ between the temperature response models, but was affected by the choice of the reference temperature. For the whole data set, a Q10 of 2 was found to be adequate for describing the temperature dependence of decomposition in the intermediate temperature range (about 5–35 °C). However, for individual experiments, Q10 values deviated greatly from 2. At least at temperatures below 5 °C, functions not based on Q10 are probably more adequate. However, due to the paucity of data from low-temperature incubations, this conclusion is only tentative, and more experimental work is called for.}},

abstract = {{Abstract. Soil moisture is of primary importance for predicting the evolution of soil carbon stocks and fluxes, both because it strongly controls organic matter decomposition and because it is predicted to change at global scales in the following decades. However, the soil functions used to model the heterotrophic respiration response to moisture have limited empirical support and introduce an uncertainty of at least 4\% in global soil carbon stock predictions by 2100. The necessity of improving the representation of this relationship in models has been highlighted in recent studies. Here we present a data-driven analysis of soil moisture-respiration relations based on 90 soils. With the use of linear models we show how the relationship between soil heterotrophic respiration and different measures of soil moisture is consistently affected by soil properties. The empirical models derived include main effects and moisture interaction effects of soil texture, organic carbon content and bulk density. When compared to other functions currently used in different soil biogeochemical models, we observe that our results can correct biases and reconcile differences within and between such functions. Ultimately, accurate predictions of the response of soil carbon to future climate scenarios will require the integration of soil-dependent moisture-respiration functions coupled with realistic representations of soil water dynamics.}},
